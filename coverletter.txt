Hello! I've been working remotely for 5+ year for US based companies. I got a lot of experience building web applications in different business domains. Most recently I've been participating in the development of the investing platform to real-estate debt. The idea is to revolutionize the historically pretty conservative market and give access to the real-estate debt market to the general public. I'm getting a lot of experience in the financial domain while I'm working there, but I feel that it's time to move on and I'm open to new adventures
